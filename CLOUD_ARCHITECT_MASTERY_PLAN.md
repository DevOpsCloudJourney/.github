# 🏔️ Cloud Architect Mastery Action Plan: 6 Months to the Summit 🧗‍♂️

## 📅 Month 1: Cloud Foundations & Design Thinking
### 🛠️ What to Learn:
- **Cloud Basics:** Choose AWS (or Azure/GCP) and explore:
  - Compute (EC2), Storage (S3), Networking (VPC), Databases (RDS)
- **Architectural Patterns:** Microservices, Serverless, Event-driven design
- **Cost Optimization:** Use AWS Pricing Calculator for basic cost analysis

### 🎯 Measurable Goals:
- Set up an EC2 instance, S3 bucket, and VPC network
- Design a simple serverless app (e.g., a Lambda function that resizes images uploaded to S3)

### 💡 Example Project:
- **Serverless Photo Resizer:** An image uploaded to S3 triggers a Lambda function that resizes the image and stores it in another bucket.

## 📅 Month 2: Develop Like an Architect 🧑‍💻
### 🛠️ What to Learn:
- **Coding Mastery:** Write scalable, secure code with Python or Go.
- **API Design:** Build REST APIs with Flask or FastAPI, and experiment with GraphQL using Apollo.

### 🎯 Measurable Goals:
- Build a REST API that manages a to-do list.
- Add API security with OAuth and JWT.

### 💡 Example Project:
- **To-Do API with Authentication:** A simple API to create, read, update, and delete to-do items with JWT-based authentication.

---

## 📅 Month 3: Deploy, Automate & Conquer 🚀
### 🛠️ What to Learn:
- **CI/CD:** Set up automated pipelines with GitHub Actions.
- **IaC:** Write Terraform code to deploy infrastructure.
- **Containers:** Dockerize your apps and deploy them with Kubernetes.

### 🎯 Measurable Goals:
- Build a CI/CD pipeline for your to-do API.
- Deploy your to-do API to Kubernetes using Terraform.

### 💡 Example Project:
- **K8s Deployed To-Do API:** Your to-do API deployed on Kubernetes with a fully automated pipeline (GitHub Actions + Terraform).

---

## 📅 Month 4: Monitor Like an SRE 👀
### 🛠️ What to Learn:
- **Observability:** Set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Reliability:** Implement SLIs and SLOs, and simulate incident response.

### 🎯 Measurable Goals:
- Monitor your deployed to-do API with Prometheus and Grafana.
- Write an SLO for API response time and create a runbook for outages.

### 💡 Example Project:
- **Monitored To-Do API:** Your API with full monitoring, alerts, and incident response guidelines.

---

## 📅 Month 5: Scale to Infinity & Beyond 📈
### 🛠️ What to Learn:
- **Scaling Techniques:** Auto-scaling, load balancing, and caching with CDN (CloudFront) and Redis.
- **Serverless Computing:** Deploy serverless functions with AWS Lambda.

### 🎯 Measurable Goals:
- Implement auto-scaling for your to-do API.
- Build a serverless microservice that sends email reminders from your to-do app.

### 💡 Example Project:
- **Serverless Reminder Service:** Lambda-based service that sends email reminders for due to-do items.

---

## 📅 Month 6: Secure, Engineer, and Innovate 🔒
### 🛠️ What to Learn:
- **Security:** Master IAM, Zero Trust, and API security with OAuth/JWT.
- **Backend Essentials:** Implement an API gateway with rate limiting and use message queues.
- **Data Engineering:** Build ETL pipelines and explore data lakes.

### 🎯 Measurable Goals:
- Add IAM-based access control to your to-do API.
- Build a simple ETL pipeline that loads CSV data into a data warehouse.

### 💡 Example Project:
- **Secure & Data-Driven API:** Your to-do API secured with IAM, connected to a message queue (SQS), and integrated with an ETL pipeline for analytics.

---

## 🎯 Ongoing Activities:
- **Earn Certifications:** Aim for AWS Solutions Architect Associate by Month 4-5.
- **Build Portfolio Projects:** Deploy all projects on GitHub and write case studies on LinkedIn.
- **Engage with Community:** Contribute to cloud architecture forums and open-source projects.
- **Stay Updated:** Follow blogs like AWS Architecture Blog and newsletters like *Last Week in AWS*.
